# Analysis-for-Statistics-House-Price-Prediction

In today's rapidly evolving real estate market, understanding the factors that influence housing prices is more important than ever. This project aims to provide a comprehensive statistical analysis of the key variables impacting housing sale prices, utilizing multiple linear regression (MLR) as a robust analytical tool.

Using the R programming language, we explored a dataset with 18 variables, rigorously applying the Gauss-Markov assumptions to ensure that our Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimates are BLUE (Best Linear Unbiased Estimator). The analysis not only delves into the current trends in the housing market but also offers a predictive framework for future housing prices.

Our final MLR model successfully predicts and analyzes sale prices, providing meaningful insights into the factors driving the real estate market. While this project establishes a solid foundation, further sophisticated statistical analyses could be employed to enhance the predictive power and accuracy of the model.
